          <div class="sub-sub-title">Interviews</div>
          <p>From our interviews, most people considered volunteer to provide help without any remuneration. People that had volunteered before did it out of the intrinsic motivation to help, receiving a valuable experience as a reward. On the other hand, people that had never volunteered, thought of doing it out of a free will and abroad in a different country.
          Regarding motivation, subjects four reasons stood out: the experience,  feeling good about oneself, the will to contribute to society and empathy.
          People that had never volunteered before didn't do it because of a lack of resources and information,  not having the motivation or considering themselves too young, according to our results. </p>

        <div class="col-12 col-sm-8" data-aos="zoom-in">
          <div class="sub-sub-title">Observations</div>

          <p>When finding out how to help, participants from the laboratory observation chose either searching on Google or reaching for personal contact. They tend to find easy to access organizations or events and once they have the contact information, look for a personal meeting. After all the information is provided on the other side, they decide whether or not to volunteer. Two key problems while doing this were trust in the organizations and lack of time to volunteer. </p>

          <p>When assisting someone needing help, subjects often start with a friendly conversation not related to the help going to be provided. Once the assisted feels comfortable, subjects continue to provide formal help. Lastly, they end with a friendly farewell. One possible issue observed when doing the context inquiry was the lack of professionalism when dealing with sensitive issues. </p>

          <p>People that need help during our ethnographic observation searched for people involved in the event or organization. Once they were sure of this, they proceeded to talk to them and accept their help. One relevant highlight from this observation was to see that most subjects were already accustomed to the process. </p>

                <p>A person in his late forties cannot cover his need for three meals a day and needs to be helped to consume enough nutrients. He does know different people with the same problems, with who he communicates a lot. It is like a small community helping each other out. He does not have a place where he can eat everyday and is wandering around, trying to find a place to eat. Most of the times he finds a way out, but the need of asking for help over and over again is still there. If he is not able to find anything, then he knows he could always go to the homeless shelter near Puerta del Sol. Sometimes he just goes there to have more people in the same situation around him so he does not feel as an outlier. He is dependent of the people willing to help him by giving him something to eat. In fact, he does not have a stable solution for his problem and every day he has to put quite enough effort on it.

                <p>A university student heard that doing some voluntary work as a social activity could be added to his CV to help him to find a good job after graduating. He heard some news about that there is some voluntary work needed in a children’s hospital near to his street, so he searched this news on the internet. This week some students had interviewed him about voluntary work, which made him realize that he also wants to do something, so he is excited to go and help at the hospital. After some while browsing the internet, he does not find the news and already feels his excitement decreasing. He decides to stop looking any further and sign up for voluntary work for the hospital on the website he happens to be on. He is a bit disappointed about not achieving as much as intended, but he is happy he still decided to help. Now he will just wait for a response of the hospital and then will see what he could do.</p>

                <p>A woman in her 30s is volunteering for an organization that is trying to help Queer people to better integrate in the society and that offers medical and psychological help. Today, the organization will have an event that provides information about the organization itself and the schedule of future events happening. For this reason she will meet with the volunteers that will be providing this information during the event. Once the volunteers arrive, she briefs them on the most important information and what to take care of during the event. Because of the amount of activities taking place in the next month, she also attends the event to recruit more volunteers. When someone approaches the table, she kindly informs about the organization's activities and answers, if possible, all their questions. If she notices that interest of the person, then she will suggest them to join the organization. Since she knows it is difficult to convince people, she is trying to sell the organization in a fun way and tries to get their contact information in order to provide further information in the future. Unfortunately, of the many people that she is talking to during the day, only very few are willing to give their information or join the organization. At the end of the event, they pick up everything and thank the volunteers.</p>

          <p>This prototype was able to perform two different tasks for each user profile. With it, we tested the usability of our design with 10 participants. After analyzing our results, we obtained three main insights from the design. First, some participants understood the events as categories and because of this, they didn't perform any search or filtering at the beginning. Interface buttons were also not clear enough, making them difficult to distinguish from other elements from the interface. Lastly, the inconsistency of text and date formats in the prototype created confusion among some subjects.</p>

The second was to interact with the scores from your friends.
